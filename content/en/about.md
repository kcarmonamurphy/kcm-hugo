intro: >-
 I'm a Full Stack Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of professional experience writing high-quality software that is well tested and documented.
  <br />  <br />
 I have experience working on a wide range of projects in a variety of industries including **FinTech**, **InfrastructureTech** and **AccountingTech**.
  <br />  <br />
 I'm most proficient in the Django, Rails, React.js and Ember frameworks, but consider myself a generalist, comfortable with a wide range of technologies.

study: >-
  Currently based in **Moncton, New Brunswick** 🇨🇦, but seeking my next remote role, wherever it may be. I'm deepening my skills as a 🪜 Full Stack Engineer by learning new technologies such as **Golang**, **Swift** and **Next.js**. New areas of interest for me include **Systems Design**, **Cloud Computing** and **DevOps**. My goal is to obtain my ☁️ AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Certification in the Spring of 2026.

passion_title: "What I'm passionate about"
passion_text: >-
  I'm passionate about solving real world pain points using **best practices** and pragmatic architectural decisions. I'm a **self-starter** who thrives in a fast-paced environment where I'm afforded autonomy to design and implement innovative solutions given demanding constraints.
  <br /> <br />
  I design and develop software across the entire stack. Most recently at Citylitics, I implemented an automated email scheduling and delivery feature end to end which eliminated hours of manual effort for our team. I leveraged GCP Cloud Tasks and Scheduler to allow our team to send personalized emails at scale without overwhelming the capacity of our production server.

mix: >-
  With experience across **front-end** and **back-end** software engineering, I bring a comprehensive understanding of software development best practices to deliver high-quality solutions to tough problems. I enjoy working closely with stakeholders to ensure that product requirements are met and that software is easy to maintain and extend.

personal: >-
  Outside of work, I enjoy cycling and lifting weights at the gym. In the winter, you can find me cross country skiing or downhill snoboarding. In the summer, I love getting around town on my bicycle. I'm quite handy around the home - if something's broken I can usually fix it.
